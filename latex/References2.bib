In this paper, a new objective function, based on genetic algorithms of Chu‚ÄìBeasley, to carry out an optimal coordination of directional overcurrent relay is presented. The characteristics of the genetic algorithms of Chu‚ÄìBeasley and some modifications, having taken into account inherent constraints to the problem, were used in order to properly solve the problem. A case study including 11 nodes and 22 directional relays was conducted to validate the performance of the proposed technique. Finally, a methodology to obtain a directional overcurrent relay coordination is proposed, including an expert (human) criterion.

This work presents an overcurrent relay coordination decision for switching the relay settings to adaptive the off-peak loading in interconnected power system. Overcurrent relays (OCR) including directional and non-directional protective relays are widely applied in power system as main protective devices as they are reliable, cost effective and selective. Usually, the OCR protective coordination is coordinated at the time of maximum load and normal power supply, which may not be adaptive, as generating and load power are decreased significantly during the off-peak period of time compare to peak load that insufficient currents caused cascade lagging to activate OCRs. An example of single-ring interconnected power system was tested to demonstrate the coordination and confirm that the proposed approach method is practical during the off-peak time."

The proposed system supervises network topology based on the monitoring functionality of numerical relays. The system detects any changes in the configuration and recalculates the directional overcurrent protection settings by using a microgenetic algorithm. The proposed system was evaluated for several operating scenarios and insertion levels of distributed generation, and then compared with both conventional and adaptive protection systems by means of a traditional genetic algorithm. The results showed that the performance of the proposed system is superior to the other two methods in terms of both speed and selectivity. This shows that this is a promising proposal for the protection of modern electric power distribution systems."

abstract = "The trend of expanding to larger underground mining systems has motivated increases in the voltage levels used for distribution and utilisation. Such increases have caused the industry to face complexities and challenges that are not common in lower voltage systems. For high voltage levels, the mining regulations require the use of shielded cables, with a resistive grounding method for the neutral. The occurrence of a phase-to-ground fault in a power system with this arrangement causes capacitive current flows from different locations to the point of failure, which reduces the selectivity of the ground overcurrent relays. The solution proposed here for this loss of selectivity is based on the ground-directional over-current algorithm. The methodology was detailed, validated, tested, and assessed using a software test model and subsequently in a real-time hardware-in-the-loop implementation in a playback testbed. The results showed an improvement in the protection performance in the context of different failure scenarios."
