IEEE-IAS********************************
Optimal coordination of 67N directional overcurrent relays  in interconnected electric power systems.
Method and results discussion available in:
P.M. De Oliveira-De Jesus, E. Sorrentino, J. S. Abello, O. Archilla, C. A. Alza, D. Celeita, G.~A.~Ramos, and A. J. Urdaneta..
IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting, to be held in Detroit in 2020
Matlab files  
LoadDatabase.m: Case study data
R67NODOCR.m: Runs a single ODOCR problem
iterR67NODOCR: Runs several ODOCR problems varying Rf from Rfmin to Rfmax
Both programs require the OpenDSS installed

Some Examples are also solved in MSExcel

DOCR_Transient_Configuration_Simulator/***********************
Simulate DOCR Scheme response: time operation & selectivity
10 study cases
run_main_DOCR_simulator (main program)
All scripts in matlab
