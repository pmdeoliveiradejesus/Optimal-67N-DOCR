Matlab files:  
LoadDatabase.m: Case study data (3 bus case)
please change your compile path in LoadDatabase.m 
R67NODOCR.m: Runs a single ODOCR problem (Matlab Live scribt is also included)
iterR67NODOCR: Runs several ODOCR problems varying the fault resistance Rf from Rfmin to Rfmax
Both programs require the OpenDSS installed
https://smartgrid.epri.com/SimulationTool.aspx (OpenDSS works in Windows)

Some Examples are also solved using MSExcel's solver (Excel folder)
Paper, presentation (ppt and mp4) also available in presentation folder
